# Machine_learning_from_scratch
Machine Learning from Scratch is an educational project implementing supervised and unsupervised algorithms entirely with NumPy. The goal is to help students understand how models are trained, tested, and evaluated by building each component step by step, without relying on prebuilt ML libraries.
