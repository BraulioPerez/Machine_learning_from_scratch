# Machine Learning from Scratch ðŸŽ“ðŸ¤–

This repository contains implementations of various **supervised** and **unsupervised** machine learning models, built **entirely with NumPy**.  
No scikit-learn, no TensorFlow, no PyTorch â€” just raw math, linear algebra, and code.  

The purpose is **educational**: to help students understand how models really work under the hood by implementing every step manually.

---

## ðŸ“š Why Only NumPy?
Most ML libraries abstract away the underlying processes. While useful in practice, this makes it harder for beginners to truly understand:  
- How models are trained  
- How weights are updated  
- How loss functions interact with optimization  
- How predictions and evaluations are computed  

By using only NumPy, youâ€™ll see how each piece fits together.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Clear, beginner-friendly implementations of classic ML algorithms  
- Step-by-step explanations and comments in the code  
- Examples of training and testing workflows  
- Both supervised and unsupervised learning models  

---

## ðŸ§  Models Implemented (so far)
### Supervised
- Decision Trees  
(More coming soon...)

### Unsupervised
(More coming soon...)
